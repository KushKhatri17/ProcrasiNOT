# ProcrasiNOT
Personal Project to learn about web dev.

Hosted of render now instead of Heroku https://procrasinot.onrender.com/

Uses Flask for the web framework and postgresql as the database. Do not store any sensitive information currently if you decide to try the app out.

Will look to add more functionality maybe such as custom thumbnails, UI improvement?
