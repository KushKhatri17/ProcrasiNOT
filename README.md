# ProcrasiNOT
Personal Project to learn about web dev.

Hosted on render now instead of Heroku https://procrasinot.onrender.com/

Render may make the hosted instance inactive, if this is the case then it will take about a minute to load the website.

Uses Flask for the web framework and postgresql as the database. Do not store any sensitive information currently if you decide to try the app out.

Will look to add more functionality maybe such as custom thumbnails, UI improvement?
